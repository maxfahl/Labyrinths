# Cursor Project Rules for Labyrinth Generator

- Always check .notes/prd.md for the current implementation phase and its tasks before starting work.
- Work on one phase at a time, create tests (both unit and E2E) and make sure they pass before moving to the next.
- Use ShadCN UI components and Tailwind CSS v4 for all UI elements, styling and layout.
- Use Jest for unit/component tests and Playwright for E2E tests. Add or update tests as features are implemented.
- Keep code modular: use separate files for components, logic, and styles.
- Ensure accessibility (labels, keyboard navigation, color contrast) and mobile responsiveness in all UI work.
- Render mazes as SVG for scalability and export features.
- Use local storage for persistence of maze history and settings.
- After each major feature or phase, update .notes/prd.md to reflect progress.
- Don't explain how to do things, just do it.
- Ensure Test-Driven Development (TDD): write tests before implementing new features and maintain green build at every step.
- After every code change, run `npm test` and `npm run test:e2e` to ensure tests pass and keep the build green.
- All code files must use TypeScript (.ts/.tsx) unless there is a specific reason not to.
