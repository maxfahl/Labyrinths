# Cursor Project Rules for Labyrinth Generator

- Always check .notes/prd.md for the current implementation phase and its tasks before starting work.
- Work on one phase at a time, completing and testing all tasks in the current phase before moving to the next.
- Use ShadCN UI components and Tailwind CSS v4 for all UI elements, styling and layout.
- Use Jest for unit/component tests and Playwright for E2E tests. Add or update tests as features are implemented.
- Keep code modular: use separate files for components, logic, and styles.
- Ensure accessibility (labels, keyboard navigation, color contrast) and mobile responsiveness in all UI work.
- Render mazes as SVG for scalability and export features.
- Use local storage for persistence of maze history and settings.
- After each major feature or phase, update .notes/prd.md to reflect progress.
- If unsure, ask for clarification or refer to the PRD and previous implementation notes.
